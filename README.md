## Installation Instructions
This is a web application; to set it up, we require a python environment with Django and other project dependencies installed.
 Though one can work with the project without a virtual environment, it is recommended to use one to avoid conflicts with other projects

## General setup

1. Make sure that you have `Python 3`, `virtualenv` and `pip` installed.     
2. Clone the repository
    ### GitHub
    ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/RMKCET-AI/tesseract.git
        $ cd tesseract
    ```  
    ### DockerHub
    ```bash
        $ docker pull thunder07/tesseract:latest
    ```
3. Create a python3 virtualenv, activate the environment and Install the project dependencies.  
    - For linux/macintosh:
    ```bash
        $ python3 -m venv venv
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```   
    - For windows:
    ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv/Scripts/activate.bat
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Docker setup
Refer docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for installation 

      
        $ docker-compose build  
        $ docker-compose up  
      
You have now successfully set up the project on your environment. 



### Steps to run
From now when you start your work, run ``source bin/activate`` inside the project repository and you can work with the django application as usual - 

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

### API documentation
We can perform all user crud operations using only one end point in the application which is ```/api/```
- Must use api key to access the api which can be generated by admin to ensure data security
- using different query_param you can access different kinds of data

```Get```
- ```random_user``` query_param to pick random user.
- ```page_number``` and ```page_size``` to specify the pagination of api.
- ```all_users``` to get all users data

```Post```
- Formdata must include ```user_name``` , ```first_name``` , ```last_name``` , ```email```, ```contact_number``` , ```address``` and ```password```

```Put```
- Put takes the same params as get and updated the whole record it takes primary key ```pk``` as identifier

```Patch```
- Patch can be one or more params that are in Post to update individual records it takes primary key ```pk``` as identifier

```Delete```
- Delete takes the primary key ```pk``` as param and deletes the particular record
